# What happens after death ?

The concept of transmigration of soul is explained in the Bhagavad Gita through the following verses:

- *Verse 2.22*: Just as a person gives up his old garment and puts on a new one, the soul similarly accepts a new body after discarding the present one.
- *Verse 2.13*: Whatsoever state (of being) one remembers at the time of death, that state he will attain after quitting this body.
- *Verse 5.43*: A person who has transcended these three conditions of nature inherent in the material body becomes liberated from the cycle of birth and death and temporary happiness, and enters into the Supreme (Me).

In each verse, the soul or atma is depicted as changing bodies, either willingly in the case of Verse 2.22 or automatically in the other two verses. The state of mind at the time of death also plays a role in determining the next body, as mentioned in Verse 2.13. Ultimately, the goal is to transcend these conditions and attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death, as explained in Verse 5.43.

# What happens after death ?

"In the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita, the concept of what happens after death is explained through the teachings of Lord Krishna. According to these verses, the soul or Atman is eternal and immortal, neither born nor can it die. The Soul exists even when the physical body perishes. Those who truly know and understand the Supreme Soul (Brahman) are able to experience Him after death and ultimately attain Him. Once a person's soul has transcended the three conditions of nature that exist within the  physical body, they become free from the cycle of birth, death, sorrow, and temporary happiness, and merge into the Lord. This is similar to how a person changes old clothing for new ones when their old clothes become worn out and useless."
